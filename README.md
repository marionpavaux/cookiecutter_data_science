# Cookiecutter Data Science

A modified version of cookiecutter Data Science : 

> _A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

### Requirements

- Python 2.7 or 3.5+
- [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter pipx poetry
```

or

```bash
$ pip install pipx poetry
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```

### Install

```bash
cookiecutter git@github.com:marionpavaux/cookie_cutter_data_science.git
```

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/244658.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/244658)

Follow the instructions in the terminal, then go in the project directory and run:

```bash
make install
```

Install all packages needed for your environment using the name of the project as the environment name. Use mamba (conda-based), or use poetry (pip-based). Poetry will create a poetry.lock file that is equivalent to requirements.txt.

### Directory structure
